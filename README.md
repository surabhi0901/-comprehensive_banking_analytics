Data
The dataset used in this project is a CSV file containing banking information. The data is loaded using pandas and various preprocessing steps are performed to prepare it for analysis and modeling.

Project Structure
Import Libraries: Importing necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling.
Data Loading: Reading the data from a CSV file.
Data Exploration: Initial exploration of the data, checking for null values, and basic data information.
Data Preprocessing: Converting categorical columns to numerical values and handling missing values.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Histograms of numerical columns.
Boxplots of numerical columns.
Correlation heatmap.
Pairplot of numerical columns.
Distribution of the target variable (Credit Score).
Countplots to analyze the effect of different features on Credit Score.
Feature Importance: Using a Random Forest Classifier to identify important features.
Customer Segmentation:
Using K-Means clustering for customer segmentation based on selected features.
Credit Risk Assessment:
Building and evaluating various classification models to predict Credit Score.
Performance Prediction:
Building and evaluating various regression models to predict Credit Score.

Results
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Histograms and boxplots provided insights into the distribution and outliers of numerical features.
The correlation heatmap helped identify relationships between features.
Pairplots visualized the relationships between pairs of features.
Countplots showed the distribution of Credit Scores based on various features.
Feature Importance
Random Forest Classifier identified the most important features influencing the Credit Score.
Customer Segmentation
